* I am also using spf13-vim-3 (http://vim.spf13.com/#install) for my vimrc settings which holds the majority of my settings. Any overrides or extra settings are located in the vimrc.local which overrides spf13 settings.
* In addition I am using JSHint (https://github.com/Shutnik/jshint2.vim) as an additional bundle
